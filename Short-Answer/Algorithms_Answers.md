#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) The runtime complexity is O(n). The memory or space used grows at the same rate as the size of the input increases in a loop.

b) The runtime is O(n^2). We are faced with a nested loop, that grows the space used at a much faster rate as the size of the input increases.


c) The runtime is O(n), because the algorithm used is a recursive n times as built in loop function. 

## Exercise II


Suppose that you have an n-story building and plenty of eggs. Suppose also that an egg gets broken if it is thrown off floor f or higher, and doesn't get broken if dropped off a floor less than floor f. Devise a strategy to determine the value of f such that the number of dropped + broken eggs is minimized.

Write out your proposed algorithm in plain English or pseudocode AND give the runtime complexity of your solution.Suppose that you have an n-story building and plenty of eggs.
